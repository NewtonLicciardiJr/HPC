# Hands-on “Working with Intel Xeon and Intel Xeon Phi Architecture”

Host phi02.ncc.unesp.br
KNL phi04.ncc.unesp.br

## 1. Understand the environment
  Execute the following command in the main host and on KNL.
  
  ```lscpu```

  what are the amount of processors / cores?
  
  How much memory is available at each cache level?

  Execute the following comand on KNL:
  
  ```numactl –H```

  How many nodes area available?
  
  2. Evaluation matrix transposition in knl
    
  2.1 run transpose using mcdram
  
  2.2 run transpose using dram
  
  2.3 run transpose in xeon
  
  What execution presents the best execution time?
